# Description
For the project CSS to the rescue I want to explore the most inovative, sometimes rediculous selectors and CSS features. With the selector-first approach I'm gonna try to make something I would have never considered a possibility using pure CSS only.

This might be a bit messy, but the main goal is to learn as much as possible about CSS.

## How to install

## Contexts
Print-stylesheet
Prefers-reduced-motion

## Challenges / restrictions
Make it responsive without mediaqueries.
Design responding to language.

## Concept
My concept resolves around a bar. A simple nearby local pub / bar. But this time the user plays the bartender or friend that drunks you up until the point of no return. With a selection of drinks you can alternate the alcohol premilage.

## Expirements
### Selectors
```:nth-of-type()```

### Pseudo selectors
```::before```
```::after```

### States
```:hover```
```:lang```


### @media
```print```
```portrait, landscape```
```prefers-reduced-motion: reduce```

### Properties
```rotate3d()```
```perspective()```
```page-break-after```
```cursor```

## Values
``

## Expirements that didn't work out
CSS counters. I tried to hack them and use them as counters. 
I managed to do that, but it doesn't
